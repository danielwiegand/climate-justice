# What is Climate Justice?

This is the code for a website which explains the basic concept of "Climate Justice": a just allocation of greenhouse gas emission rights under proviso of limiting global climate change.

The page is available under https://what-is-climate-justice.org

## Data sources

Several data sources are used, mainly the Global Carbon Project (https://www.globalcarbonproject.org) and IPCC's Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5Â°C (SR15, available at https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/).

## Technical implementation

The code is written in R and makes use on the "Shiny" package for interactivity (http://shiny.rstudio.com/). A dedicated R package ("climateR", located in the app folder) contains some important functions. The page is hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS).
